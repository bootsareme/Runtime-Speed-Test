# C++ Runtime Benchmark Test
A command line utility tool that tests your C++ runtime environment. The program will make your computer undergo a series of 5 different benchmark diagnostics.

<h2>How to use?</h2>
This program is designed to be used as a CLI utility tool. That means you cannot run the .exe file without using command prompt. The basic startup command for this program is

> **benchmark --start**

From there, you can follow the instructions within the program. Use **benchmark /help** for more information. We recommend you to put benchmark.exe in your C:/Users/_YOURNAME_ folder. Because command prompt's default directory is your user directory, accessing this .exe file will be easy and will require no directory changing. More advanced users may edit their environment PATH variables.

<h2>Download</h2>
Go to the "release" tab and download the .exe file from there. The binary will be a standalone executable without any setup or installation required.

<h2>Building</h2>
To build this benchmark, you must have Visual Studio 2019+ with MSVC build tools installed. You may clone the repository using `git` or download the source via a zip file and extract it to your work folder. Open the solution in Visual Studio and follow the instructions from there.
